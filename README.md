# ðŸš€ Agentic AI â€“ Building Autonomous Agents That Think, Search & Analyze Like Humans

Designed and developed a cutting-edge Agentic AI system that mimics human-like research workflowsâ€”capable of searching the web, analyzing financial data and preparing detailed report from it, and making informed decisions autonomously. This project fuses the power of LangChain and LangGraph with real-time data and tool-based reasoning to create a highly modular, intelligent agent ecosystem.

### ðŸ§  Key Capabilities:
Autonomous agent workflows using LangGraph for conditional, state-based execution

Real-time financial intelligence using YFinance for stock fundamentals, historical data, and live prices

Contextual web awareness via Tavily API and Google News, enabling up-to-date search and news summarization

Python REPL tooling for runtime computation, analysis, and charting

Integrated memory & tool routing, enabling agents to evolve decisions over multi-turn interactions
